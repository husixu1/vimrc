# ABOUT

this is an vim config specified for Linux and Termux (an terminal simulator on Android and iOS)
to use it, follow the instructions below

# TO USE THIS CONFIG

## auto-installation

---

run `./one-key-install.sh` WITHOUT root privilige.

## manual-installation

---

* put all directories into your .vim dir
* put vimrc in your home dir
* rename it to .vimrc
* run `curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim`
* run `vim +PlugInstall`

### YCM config

* either-> create your own .ycm\_extra\_conf.py and put it in ~/.vim/custom
* or-----> use the ycm\_extra\_conf.py in this repo insted (do not have to change anything)

* in the ~/.vim/plugged/YouCompleteMe dir, run `python install.py --help` for help (usually if you only want C-family complete, run `python install.py --clang-completer`; and in Termux, run `python install.py --clang-completer --system-libclang`)

* once YCM functions normally, it's better to froze it from updating(add 'frozen' to ycm config in .vimrc). Updating YCM is somehow possible to cause a staring failure (fixable, though).

#### known issues:
* if Ycm didn't function normally, run :YcmDebugInfo and see corresponding file for debug info
* if YCM SUFFERS AN SHUTDOWN, PLEASE RECOMPILE THE YCM COREï¼š
* if you have run vim +PlugUpdate, YCM CORE might be too old to use, and should be recompiled manually
* sometimes use system libclang fix the problem (and it's a must for Temux users)
* if libtinfo missing, install it (from AUR for archlinux users), link it to a correct filename according to the debug info, and recompile ycm core
* if libtinfo is still missing after the yaourt installation, install ncurses5-compat-libs from yaourt
