# ABOUT

this is an vim config specified for Linux and Termux (an terminal simulator on Android and iOS)
to use it, follow the instructions below

# TO USE THIS CONFIG

## auto-installation

---

run `./one-key-install.sh` WITHOUT root privilige( not tested, do not use it for now )

## manual-installation

---

* put all directories into your .vim dir
* put vimrc in your home dir
* rename it to .vimrc
* run `curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim`
* run `vim +PlugInstall`

### YCM config

* either-> create your own .ycm\_extra\_conf.py and put it in ~/.vim/custom
* or-----> use the ycm\_extra\_conf.py in this repo insted (do not have to change anything)

* in the ~/.vim/plugged/YouCompleteMe dir, run `python install.py --help` for help (usually if you only want C-family complete, run `python install.py --clang-completer`; and in Termux, run `python install.py --clang-completer --system-libclang`)

* once YCM functions normally, it's better to froze it from updating(add 'frozen' to ycm config in .vimrc). Updating YCM is somehow possible to cause a staring failure (fixable, though).

#### known issues:
*if Ycm didn't function normally, run :YcmDebugInfo and see corresponding file for debug info*
*if YCM SUFFERS AN SHUTDOWN, PLEASE RECOMPILE THE YCM COREï¼š*
*if you have run vim +PlugUpdate, YCM CORE might be too old to use, and should be recompiled manually*
*sometimes use system libclang fix the problem (and it's a must for Temux users)*
*if libtinfo missing, install it (from AUR for archlinux users), link it to a correct filename according to the debug info, and recompile ycm core*

### Clewn installation (Optional)

#### on Linux
* cd to clewn-1.5 dir
* run `export vimdir=<your vim dir>`
* run `./configure --prefix=<build dir>`
* run `make && make install`

#### on Termux
* cd to clewn-1.5 dir
* run `export vimdir=<your vim dir>`
* run `autoconf`
* run `./configure --prefix=<build dir>`
* add `#define USE_GETCWD` to the first line of misc.c
* change the fist line of `script/install-sh` accordingly
* run `make && make install`
