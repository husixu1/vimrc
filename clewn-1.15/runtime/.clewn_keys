# .clewn_keys file
# The default placement for this file is $CLEWNDIR/.clewn_keys, or
# $HOME/.clewn_keys
#
# Key definitions are of the form `KEY:GDB COMMAND:{%line|%text}'
# where:
#    %text: the text below the mouse is added to the GDB command
#    %line: 'fname:lnum' are added to the GDB command, where fname is the
#           current buffer full pathname, and lnum the line number at
#           cursor position
#
# All characters following `#' up to the next new line are ignored.
# Leading blanks on each line are ignored. Empty lines are ignored.
#
# To tune the settings in this file, you will have to uncomment them,
# as well as change them, as the values on the commented-out lines
# are the default values. You can also add new entries. To remove a
# default mapping, use an empty GDB command.
#
# There are two different KEY naming schemes, depending on which vim
# version is running, please refer to the documentation for an
# explanation of this difference.
