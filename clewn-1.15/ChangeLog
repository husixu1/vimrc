	* netbeans.c gdb.h clewn.c misc.c gdb_lvl2.c gdb_lvl3.c: correct
	compilation warnings with gcc 4.3.2.

	* gdb_lvl3.c: fix clewn hangs on startup with ubuntu 9.10 where gdb
	responses are received in one big chunk of data.

===============================================================================
2008-10-19  Xavier de Gaye <xdegaye at users dot sourceforge dot net>

	* clewn.c: no error message when Vim is not compiled with
	netbeans_intg.

	* gdb_lvl3.c: fix bunch of ^M characters in vimGdb console
	on Mac OS X.

	* configure.ac netbeans.c clewn.c clewn.h misc.c gdb_lvl2.c
	gdb_lvl3.c: suppress signedness warnings when built with gcc 4.1.2.

	* obstack.c: exitfail.h and gettext.h are not needed and may not be
	pesent on Cygwin platforms.

===============================================================================
2007-12-28  Xavier de Gaye <xdegaye at users dot sourceforge dot net>

	* gdb_lvl3.c: always write at the start of a new line, the result
	of the concatenation of multiple small chunks output by gdb.

	* misc.c: find the source when they have been compiled with an
	absolute path and moved later

	* clewn.c gdb_lvl3.c: Rename the clewn 'restart' command to
	'cl_restart'.

===============================================================================
2007-07-19  Xavier de Gaye <xdegaye at users dot sourceforge dot net>

	*  netbeans.c misc.c misc.h gdb.h gdb.c gdb_lvl3.c:
	Retrofit the changes made in clewn 1.8 to vimgdb: locate the source
	file by using the program debugging information provided by gdb

===============================================================================
2007-01-22  Xavier de Gaye <xdegaye at users dot sourceforge dot net>

	*  clewn.c clewn.h gdb.h netbeans.c gdb_lvl3.c: the error message
	"Clewn cannot find file foobar.c in GDB source directories"
	is printed at each prompt instead of once.

	* netbeans.c: close the asm buffers when running netbeans version 2.4;
	Vim version 7.0 after the patch 163.

	* gdb_lvl3.c: file loaded from the project file overwrites the
	file loaded from the command line, warn the user

	* clewn.h clewn.c netbeans.c:
	Use the new netbeans 2.4 getAnno function (vim patch 163) to get the
	breakpoint position that is saved in the project file

	* clewn.c:
	Add support for the disable command in the project file

	* netbeans.c:
	When $cdir is set in the gdb directories variable (the default),clewn
	uses the source full path name instead of the short name in remote
	debugging, to map the gdb path name to the vim path name. The list of
	source full path names can be obtained with the gdb command
	'interpreter-exec mi "-file-list-exec-source-files"'

	* clewn.c gdb_lvl3.c:
	Get the source file list from gdb after a 'source' command, in
	case the sourced command file includes a command loading a new
	program.

	* clewn.vim clewn.c:
	When a project file is being used, a message is printed in Vim when
	the user attempts to quit Vim, to warn him that the breakpoints will
	not be saved to the project file if he proceeds with the operation.


	* clewn.c gdb.h gdb_lvl3.c:
	The project file stores the current gdb settings. They are
	automatically sourced by clewn on gdb startup and saved by clewn when
	quitting or when restarting gdb. These settings are the gdb current
	working directory, the program file to debug, the command line
	arguments passed to this program when run by gdb, and the list of
	breakpoints set in this program.


	* clewn.c: when '-va -g' is missing from the command line, vim does
	not start the GUI

	* runtime/macros/clewn_mappings.vim:
	fix cannot unmap vim keys set by clewn, when using vim 7.0 or above

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac:
	use GNU automake to build, install and distribute clewn

===============================================================================
2006-08-25  Xavier de Gaye <xdegaye at users dot sourceforge dot net>

	* Makefile.in:
	disable pointer signedness warnings in gcc 4.0 (assume GNU make)

	* gdb_lvl3.c:
	for very large gdb startup time: increase SG_TIMEOUT to 120 seconds

	* clewn.h, clewn.c, netbeans.c, clewn.vim, .clewn_keys:
	When talking to vim 7.0, clewn sends the key maps commands directly to
	vim, and there is no need to source a clewn_mappings.vim file at startup
	as with the previous vim versions.

	* clewn.h, clewn.c, netbeans.c:
	When doing remote debugging, the parameter of the '-x' command line
	argument, lists the pathname translations to be applied from target to
	host and vice-versa.

	* clewn.c, misc.c, clewn.vim:
	New command line arguments:
	-vc gvim_cmd  - gvim shell command or gvim pathname (dflt 'gvim')
	-va gvim_args - gvim command line arguments
	-gc gdb_cmd   - gdb shell command or gdb pathname (dflt 'gdb')
	-ga gdb_args  - gdb command line arguments

	* gdb.h, gdb_lvl3.c, gdb_lvl2.c:
	fix regression in lvl2 (gdb 5.3): the lvl2 array of oobfunc functions
	is not correctrly restored after running a one shot oobfunc function

	* gdb.h, clewn.h, clewn.c, gdb_lvl3.c, netbeans.c, clewn.vim:
	respawn gdb on the 'restart' command - 'quit' and ^D commands send the
	netbeans function 'saveAndExit'
	print clewn version on startup

	* obstack.c, obstack.h:
	updating obstack to latest glibc 2.4

===============================================================================
2006-07-22  Xavier de Gaye <xdegaye at users dot sourceforge dot net>

	* gdb.h, clewn.c, gdb_lvl3.c:
	fixed jumping back to last gdb frame sign after displaying a balloon
	evaluation or after clearing a breakpoint

	* gdb_lvl3.c:
	the gdb `run' commands do input and output with the clewn terminal
	fixed extra new line after gdb 'step' command

===============================================================================
2006-06-11  Xavier de Gaye <xdegaye at users dot sourceforge dot net>

	* gdb.h, clewn.h, clewn.c, gdb_lvl3.c, netbeans.c:
	support of $cdir (member of the 'directory' gdb variable)

	* gdb.h, clewn.c, gdb_lvl3.c:
	fixed out of sync frame stack after printing an expression that causes
	the evaluation of one of the debugged program functions.

	* gdb_lvl3.c:
	fixed browsing the gdb frame stack after an assertion failure, when
	assembly support is enabled.

	* gdb_lvl3.c:
	fixed parsing of a long (greater than 1024 characters) gdb 'directory'
	list, and fixed the garbled display by clewn of very long lines output by
	gdb, as for example in the output of the gdb command 'show directory'

===============================================================================
2006-04-08  Xavier de Gaye <xdegaye at users dot sourceforge dot net>

	* gdb.h, clewn.h, clewn.c, gdb_lvl3.c, netbeans.c:
	use netBeans showBalloon to display a variable value in Vim
	option '-t' is left unchanged, but not documented anymore

	* clewn.c:
	read the clewn default key mappings from a static array

	* runtime/clewn.vim:
	set balloondelay to 100 msec

	* clewn.c:
	quote filenames to allow for spaces in set/delete breakpoints
	warn the user when the Vim socket is not established yet
	EMSG() writes to readline stdio stream

	* Makefile.in, clewn.c, pty.c:
	disable pointer signedness warnings in gcc 4.0, and fix some prototypes

	* clewn.c, gdb_lvl2.c, gdb_lvl3.c, netbeans.c, obstack.c:
	bug fix: obstack.h is not a system header

	* gdb_lvl3.c:
	gdb 6.4 does not provide annotations for breakpoints in level 3. Note
	that they are still there when setting annotate level 2, level 2 was
	supposed to be deprecated ? So we always look for new or changed
	breakpoints now.

===============================================================================
2006-02-07  Xavier de Gaye <xdegaye at users dot sourceforge dot net>

	* clewn.c, netbeans.c:
	revert the meaning of option '-r'
	options '-v', '-m' and '-i' have been removed

	* clewn.c:
	add option '-f' and fork gvim

	* netbeans.c:
	do not send the stopDocumentListen netbeans command to Vim for
	the variables buffer; this fixes the bug that hangs the variables
	window after a variable has been deleted

	* clewn.c, misc.c, misc.h:
	accepting multiple (possibly quoted) tokens after the -p command line
	option

	* clewn.c, netbeans.c, gdb.h, gdb_lvl3.c:
	add option '-x' for remote debugging

===============================================================================
2005-12-02  Xavier de Gaye <xdegaye at users dot sourceforge dot net>

	* build configure with autoconf 2.59 and update build for
	cross-compiling

2005-11-22  Xavier de Gaye <xdegaye at users dot sourceforge dot net>

	* update configure and add some include files for freebsd build
	(maurice barnum)

===============================================================================
2004-08-29  Xavier de Gaye <xdegaye at users dot sourceforge dot net>

	* clewn.c: exec_gdb()
	FIX: using "-async" option when spawning GDB 6.2 causes GDB to fail:
	this option has been removed from GDB 6.2. Setting this option is
	unnecessary anyway, since when the standard input is connected to a
	terminal device, GDB uses the asynchronous event loop by default.

===============================================================================
2004-06-10  Xavier de Gaye <xdegaye at users dot sourceforge dot net>

	* netbeans.c: cnb_define_sign():
	FIX: cnb_define_sign() returned invalid typenr when the frame sign
	was defined more than once in a given buffer; this caused the
	breakpoint not to be set with Vim error message: "E155: Unknown sign: 0"

===============================================================================

2004-05-15  Xavier de Gaye <xdegaye at users dot sourceforge dot net>

	* misc.c: define xmalloc() - misc.c is also linked with VimGDB

	* obstack.c: use an obstack in searchfor(), cnb_close(), cnb_data_evt()
	and gdb_parse_output_cli()

===============================================================================

2004-05-07  Xavier de Gaye <xdegaye at users dot sourceforge dot net>

	* Release Clewn 1.1
