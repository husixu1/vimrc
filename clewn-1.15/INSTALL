INSTALL.txt - Clewn installation notes.

    a) required
    b) build
    c) install
    d) remote debugging


a) REQUIRED:
------------
    GDB:	    gdb 6.8 or any previous version, starting from gdb 5.3
    VIM:	    any version starting from Vim 6.3 with
		    the |+netbeans_intg| feature enabled
    GNU readline

Note that clewn can only be used with gvim, as vim, the version of VIM that
runs in a terminal, does not support NetBeans.

There is no need for you to check for the existence of the readline library:
when configure is run, a check is made to ensure that readline can be found
on your system. GNU readline can be found at:
    http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html


b) BUILD:
---------
In the clewn directory, run the following commands:

    $ ./configure
    $ make

For a user local installation that does not require root privileges, run
the following configure command:

    $ vimdir=$HOME/.vim  ./configure  --prefix=$HOME

In this case, the clewn program is installed in $HOME/bin, and the vim
runtime files in $vimdir.


c) INSTALL:
-----------
In the clewn directory, run the following command:

    $ make install

You can now use the ":help clewn" command within vim, to get access to the
clewn documentation.

Run 'make uninstall', to uninstall clewn.


d) REMOTE DEBUGGING:
--------------------
When cross-compiling, add the --host and --build argument on the command
line of configure. Then run make. For example, with an arm target:

./configure CC=/path_to_gcc/arm-gcc --build=i686-pc-linux-gnu --host=arm-linux

The readline and curses libraries must be available on the target.

The following commands are run:

    host:	gvim -c "run clewn.vim" -nb:target_ip_address
    target:	clewn -x pathnames_map -nb:target_ip_address
